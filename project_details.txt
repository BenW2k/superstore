Going to separate the different regions then do a sales dashboard based on this.

Stuff to include

time-series for the different product categories for each regions
Basic stats like total revenue
Possibly finding the 5 best selling products in each region.

Maybe overall statistics?

Going to be splitting the dataset into regions and then further into subcategories
Page 1 - Overall statistics and trends
Subsequent pages - Split by regions with time series forecasting of each product subcategory on the same chart each denoted by a different colour line.
